## Setup

Install and configure a general AI assistant API (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic) and set up a basic development environment with Python and a web framework like Flask or Django

## Tasks

1. Define your SaaS concept and outline key features for a minimum viable product
2. Use the AI assistant to generate a basic project structure and initial code scaffolding
3. Implement core functionality by iteratively prompting the AI and refining its output
4. Design and integrate a simple user interface using AI-generated HTML/CSS templates
5. Deploy the MVP to a cloud platform (e.g. Heroku, AWS) and set up basic monitoring
