# Lab 1: Initial Bug Identification

## Setup

Navigate to the `labs/project` directory in this repository. The project contains a Snake game with a Rust backend API and an HTML/JavaScript frontend.

## Project Structure

- `snake/` - Rust backend API that handles game logic
- `index.html` - Frontend HTML file with incomplete JavaScript implementation

## Tasks

1. Identify the specific bugs or issues in the codebase by examining both the Rust and JavaScript code
2. Use AI-powered code analysis tools to scan the project for potential problems
3. Set up debugging environment to test the current state of the application
4. Document at least 3 specific issues you find in the codebase
5. Apply AI suggestions to fix one identified bug and test the solution

## Expected Issues to Look For

- Incomplete JavaScript functions in the HTML file
- Logic errors in the Rust game state management
- API endpoint inconsistencies
- Frontend-backend communication problems
