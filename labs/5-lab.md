# Lab 5: Final Review and Implementation

## Setup

Ensure you have a development environment with all necessary tools and have completed the previous labs.

## Tasks

1. Review and list the key patterns and workflows learned from the previous labs
2. Identify any remaining issues in the Snake game project that need to be addressed
3. Create a comprehensive plan for implementing the learned debugging patterns in future projects
4. Set up a test environment to practice applying these debugging concepts
5. Document your findings and create a summary of best practices for debugging with AI

## Reflection Topics

- **Debugging Workflow**: What was the most effective approach for finding bugs?
- **AI Assistance**: How did AI tools help in the debugging process?
- **Testing Strategy**: What testing approaches were most valuable?
- **Issue Documentation**: How can bug reports be improved for better resolution?

## Final Deliverables

- Summary document of debugging best practices
- Template for future bug reports
- Checklist for debugging complex codebases
- Recommendations for AI-assisted debugging workflows
