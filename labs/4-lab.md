# Lab 4: AI-Powered Context Analysis

## Setup

Use an AI service of your choice (web-based or terminal-based like Claude Code) for this lab. You will create thorough context to produce an articulate and detailed bug issue report.

## Tasks

1. Gather all the context about the Snake game project and add it to the AI service you've chosen
2. Include information about the project structure, languages used (Rust + JavaScript), dependencies, environment, and source code
3. Ask the AI for a concise summary of the project and to list and prioritize the most pressing issues to solve
4. Create a detailed issue report based on the AI's analysis
5. Attempt to solve the highest priority issue using AI assistance and previous debugging techniques

## Context to Provide to AI

- Project structure and file organization
- Rust backend code (`snake/src/main.rs`)
- Frontend HTML/JavaScript code (`index.html`)
- Dependencies (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`)
- Any error messages or issues you've encountered
- Previous testing results (if Lab 3 was completed)

## Expected Deliverables

- AI-generated project summary
- Prioritized list of issues
- Detailed issue report for the most critical problem
- Solution attempt with documentation of the debugging process
