# Lab 2: Deep Code Analysis and Issue Creation

## Setup

The Snake game project in `labs/project` has multiple issues that need to be identified and documented. You should have completed Lab 1 and have a basic understanding of the codebase.

## Tasks

1. Do a deep analysis on the Rust backend code (`snake/src/main.rs`)
2. Identify potential issues in both backend logic and frontend implementation
3. Create detailed issue descriptions for each problem found
4. Try to solve one of the issues using AI assistance
5. Ensure you document your findings with specific line numbers and code examples

## Areas to Focus On

- **Rust Backend Issues**: Check for logic errors, potential panics, memory safety, and API design flaws
- **Frontend Issues**: Look for incomplete functions, UI/UX problems, and integration issues
- **Integration Issues**: Examine how the frontend and backend communicate

## Expected Deliverables

- At least 3-5 detailed issue descriptions
- One attempted fix with explanation
- Documentation of the debugging process used
