## Introduction

Welcome to the "Debug with AI" course! This course will guide you through the process of using AI assistant tools to identify, analyze, and fix bugs in a complex codebase. You'll work with a real Snake game project that contains intentional bugs and incomplete implementations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Systematically identify bugs and issues in multi-language codebases
* Use AI-powered code analysis tools to scan projects for potential problems
* Create comprehensive test coverage to catch bugs early
* Document issues effectively for team collaboration
* Apply AI suggestions to fix identified bugs and verify solutions

## What You'll Build

You will use AI to find and fix issues in a Snake game project with both Rust backend and JavaScript frontend components.

* Debug a Rust API that handles game logic and state management
* Fix incomplete JavaScript frontend implementation
* Create comprehensive testing strategies
* Develop effective debugging workflows
* Master AI-assisted debugging techniques

## Labs

This course includes a series of labs to provide you with hands-on experience. Each lab corresponds to a lesson and will guide you through the practical steps for applying debugging techniques using the Snake game project in `labs/project/`.

* [Lab 1: Initial Bug Identification](./labs/1-lab.md) - Identify bugs and issues in the codebase
* [Lab 2: Deep Code Analysis and Issue Creation](./labs/2-lab.md) - Analyze code and document detailed issues
* [Lab 3: Test Coverage and Bug Fixing](./labs/3-lab.md) - Create comprehensive tests and achieve >80% coverage
* [Lab 4: AI-Powered Context Analysis](./labs/4-lab.md) - Use AI to analyze project context and prioritize issues
* [Lab 5: Final Review and Implementation](./labs/5-lab.md) - Review learnings and create debugging best practices

## Project Structure

The `labs/project/` directory contains:
- **Snake game backend**: Rust API (`snake/src/main.rs`) that handles game logic
- **Frontend**: HTML/JavaScript interface (`index.html`) with incomplete implementation
- **Dependencies**: Rust project configuration (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`)
